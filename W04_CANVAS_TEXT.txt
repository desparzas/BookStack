W04 PROJECT CHECKPOINT - BOOKSTACK
Team: Arthur Weale, Jaime Santiago Herrera, David Esparza
Submitted by: David Esparza

=== MEETING SUMMARY ===

Date: November 29, 2024
Participants: David Esparza (Individual work)

Due to continued lack of communication from team members (Andrea left the group, Arthur and Jaime did not respond), I completed this checkpoint individually.

=== WORK COMPLETED THIS WEEK ===

1. PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE
   - Created Blazor Server application (.NET 9)
   - Configured Entity Framework Core with SQLite
   - Set up project structure (Models, Controllers, Data, Components)

2. DATABASE IMPLEMENTATION
   - 7 entity models with validation (Book, Author, Genre, Shelf, Review + join tables)
   - DbContext with many-to-many relationships
   - Seed data: 10 books, 10 authors, 10 genres, 4 shelves

3. REST API
   - BooksController: 6 endpoints (CRUD + search)
   - ShelvesController: 7 endpoints (CRUD + book management)
   - All endpoints use async/await

4. BLAZOR UI
   - Home page with dashboard
   - Books catalog page with cards
   - Shelves management page
   - Responsive Bootstrap design

5. INTEGRATION
   - Dependency injection configured
   - Database auto-seeding on startup
   - Interactive server rendering

=== CHALLENGES ===
- Team coordination: Complete lack of participation from other members
- OpenAPI compatibility: Resolved by simplifying API configuration
- Many-to-many relationships: Required Fluent API configuration
- Time management: Balancing scope with deadline

=== SUCCESSES ===
- ✅ Complete working application built from scratch
- ✅ Complex database relationships implemented correctly
- ✅ RESTful API following best practices
- ✅ Responsive UI with Bootstrap
- ✅ Build status: 0 errors

=== INSIGHTS ===
- EF Core Fluent API provides elegant solutions for complex relationships
- Blazor interactive server rendering simplifies development
- Async/await patterns improve scalability
- Clear separation of concerns aids maintainability
- Comprehensive seed data crucial for testing
